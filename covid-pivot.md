## Notes from Meeting
 
### Hiding COVID Data from the Public

> The Deputy Director for the UMN's Center for Infections Disease Resaerch and Policy (CIDRAP), **Jill DeBoer**, pushed back against reporting University COVID data publicly, because the data would be incomplete. Essential, **Jill DeBoer** claimed that the data would under represent the total number of cases and therefore should not be published at all. Her arguments are all red herrings. Data sets are rarely perfect. [@CIDRAP](https://twitter.com/cidrap) researchers understand this. Why does **President Gabel's** administration want to hide COVID data?

> "I think [reporting public COVID data] is fairly simple. Number of tests given. Number of positive tests received. Let's not hide the data from the students who's data is being used for the material. Let's not underestimate the public and student's ability to manage and understand the data and the limitations of the data." - **Regent Richard Beeson** #UMNProud

### Pivot Proposal's Disingenuous Riders

> **UMN President Gabel's** COVID "Pivot" proposal disingenuously combines two issues: (1) opening the UMN to on-campus learning and (2) delaying the on-campus student move in date. **Gabel** frames the move-in delay as a fairness and safety issue. The proposal passed 8-3.

> **Regent Jane Mayeron** voiced that it was important to vote on each issues in **President Gabel's** COVID Pivot proposal separately. **Regent Beeson** and **Rosha** also showed interest separate votes, but when pushed **Regent Mayeron** did not make a motion to split the question. This despite her stated belief that risks implied in the proposal would not just be to individuals, but to the community at large. **Regent Mayeron** voted for the joint proposal.

> **President Gabel** believes it would be unfair for students to move in before on-campus learning begins because, they would not have access to normal residential amenities, like the gymnasium and student dining halls. #UMNSafety

> [UofM **Regent Chair Kendall Powell** scuttled **Regent Hsu's** motion for a vote to make the UMN COVID data public. **Jill DeBoer** offered more red herrings to hide data on behalf of **President Gabriel**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&feature=youtu.be&t=7822)

### Student Chair

> "When we think not just about this decision but, the pandemic at large, we have to remember that getting this wrong means people dying. We know the slides of the financial impacts, peoples college experience at stake, but that's not it. We have to bring it back to, "it's a pandemic" and the currency is lives here.", **Regent Mike Kenyanya** said before voting for the proposal to allow on-campus teaching.

### Sviggum is Dangerous to Minnesotans

> [UofM **Regent Sviggum** flippantly asked that if a majority of the population will be infected with COVID, why not just live life as normal? #UMNSafety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&feature=youtu.be&t=5277)

> [#UMN **Regent Sviggum** is not concerned with the personal health risk of COVID to students, since they are young. **Sviggum** then states that health experts would attribute the true risk of young people catching COVID to them transmitting the virus. He then attacks the panels health expert, **Dr. Osterholm**, for not condemning transmission during the George Floyd protest.](https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5492)

> **Sviggum** clearly understands that health experts are concerned with young people, like students, spreading COVID, but he would rather make personal attacks against those experts than deal with the safety of Minnesotans. #UMNShame

> [UofM **Regent Sviggum** is not acting in a fashion that is exercising reasonable care in his responsibilities to keep students and our community safe.](https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=8933)

> [**Sviggum** ridiculed the panels health expert, **Dr. Michael Osterholm**, for his concern over COVID transmission during the Stergies Bike Rally, but that "chaos in protests were not held up to the same health concerns". The UMN Board of **Regents Chair Kendall Powell** did not call on **Dr. Osterholm** to respond to **Sviggum's** racist analogy.](https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5539)

> [**Sviggum** should resign from the University Board or Regents, again.](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2012/03/08/sviggum-dayton-embarrassment)

> [Later, **Sviggum** commented that this isn't the first time that there was "significant chaos in higher education" and refers to the "chaos" of the civil rights and antiwar movement.](https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5492)

### McMillan judges COVID Pandemic locally

> **UMN's Board of Regent's David McMillan** believes that decisions for a pandemic should be based on LOCAL, specifically "Upper-Midwest", data. If **McMillan** does not understand the definition and implications of a PANDEMIC he should not be making these decisions.
>> :eyes: shoehorning cherry picked data for future decisions.
>>> The Chair, **Kendall Powell**, praised and embraced **McMillan's** pandemic analysis.

### Regent Worry over Legal Liability

> [**Regent McMillan** is concerned with the legal liability between language in the UMN housing contract and student "risks". Particularly, when it comes to their parents.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&feature=youtu.be&t=8667)

> [To **Regent McMillan's** legal concern, **UMN's General Council** stated that it wasn't so much a contract law issue, but a legal question of what responsibilities the UMN Board of Regents has to keep students & the community safe and are the regents acting in a fashion that exercises reasonable care. The **Council** emphasised focusing on reasonable care.](https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=8933)

> **Chair Kendall Powell** interpreted the **Council's** advice as: "It's a public health issue we are focusing on and what is our duty in that regard." By their words and actions, public health was not a major concern of those who voted for **President Gabel's** proposal.
